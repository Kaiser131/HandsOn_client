# HandsOn – A Community-Driven Social Volunteering Platform

## Project Description
HandsOn is a community-driven social volunteering platform designed to connect individuals with meaningful social impact opportunities. Users can discover and participate in volunteer-driven events, post requests for community help, form teams for large-scale initiatives, and track their contributions on both personal and team levels.

By fostering social responsibility, community collaboration, and proactive engagement, HandsOn aims to make volunteering structured, engaging, and impactful.

💡 Think of it as a "GitHub for social work"—where people contribute their time instead of code, building real-world impact together.
